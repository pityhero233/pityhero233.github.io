<blockquote><p>The O-rings were two rubber rings that formed a seal between two sections of the SRBs. The sections of the boosters were joined using tang and clevis joints and the rings were intended to seal the joint while allowing for the inevitable movement between the sections under flight conditions. By design, pressure from within the booster was to push a fillet of putty into the joint, forcing the O-ring into its seat. The system never functioned as designed. The rings were supposed to sit in a groove and seal the joint between the sections of the booster. It was found, however, that flight dynamics caused the joints in the SRBs to flex during launch, opening a gap through which rocket exhaust could escape. As the joints flexed, the rings would come out of their grooves and move to a new position in the joint, a process called extrusion. The extruded ring would form a seal in this new position, but during the time it took for the ring to shift, the joint was unsealed and hot gases could escape, a process called blow-by. These hot gases damaged the rings until the seal was achieved.</p>
<p>Boisjoly’s investigation showed that the amount of damage to the O-ring depended on the length of time it took for the ring to move out of its groove and make the seal, and that the amount of time depended on the temperature of the rings. Cold weather made the rubber hard and less flexible, meaning that extrusion took more time and more blow-by took place. He determined that if the O-rings were damaged enough they could fail.</p>
<p>If the second O-ring had failed, the results would almost certainly have been catastrophic with the complete loss of the shuttle and crew seemingly the only outcome. His investigation found that the first O-ring failed because the low temperatures on the night before the flight had compromised the flexibility of the O-ring, reducing its ability to form a seal. The temperature at launch had been only 10 °C (50 °F), the coldest on record (until January 28, 1986). The first rubber O-ring had formed a partial seal, not a complete one; but the second O-ring had held.</p>
<p>Boisjoly sent a memo describing the problem to his managers, but was apparently ignored.[8] Following several further memos, a task force was convened to investigate the matter, but after a month Boisjoly realized that the task force had no power, no resources, and no management support. In late 1985 Boisjoly advised his managers that if the problem was not fixed, there was a distinct chance that a shuttle mission would end in disaster. No action was taken.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="disaster"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#disaster"></a> Disaster</h2>
<blockquote><p>Following the announcement that the Challenger mission was confirmed for January 28, 1986, Boisjoly and his colleagues tried to stop the flight. Temperatures were due to fall to −1 °C (30 °F) overnight. Boisjoly felt that this would severely compromise the safety of the O-ring and potentially the flight.</p>
<p>The matter was discussed with Morton Thiokol managers, who agreed that the issue was serious enough to recommend delaying the flight. NASA protocols required all shuttle sub-contractors to sign off on each flight. During the go/no-go telephone conference with NASA management the night before the launch, Morton Thiokol notified NASA of their recommendation to postpone. NASA officials strongly questioned the recommendations, and asked (some say pressured) Morton Thiokol to reverse their decision.</p>
<p>The Morton Thiokol managers asked for a few minutes off the phone to discuss their final position again. The management team held a meeting from which the engineering team, including Boisjoly and others, were deliberately excluded. The Morton Thiokol managers advised NASA that their data was inconclusive. NASA asked if there were objections. Hearing none, NASA decided to launch the STS-51-L Challenger mission.</p>
<p>Historians have noted that this was the first time NASA had ever launched a mission after having received an explicit no-go recommendation from a major contractor, and that questioning the recommendation and asking for a reconsideration was highly unusual. Many have also noted that the sharp questioning of the no-go recommendation stands out in contrast to the immediate and unquestioning acceptance when the recommendation was changed to a go.</p>
<p>The concerns of Boisjoly proved correct.[9] Initially, Boisjoly was relieved when the flight lifted off, as he had predicted that the SRB would explode before lift-off.</p>
<p>Upon ignition, the O-ring was burned to ash, which formed a weak seal in the joint. At 58 seconds after launch, the shuttle was buffeted by high-altitude winds, the ash seal collapsed, and hot gases streamed out of the joint in a visible blowtorch-like plume that burned into the external hydrogen tank. At about 73 seconds, the adjacent SRB strut gave way and the vehicle quickly disintegrated.</p>

<h2 id="comments"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#comments"></a> Comments</h2>
<blockquote><p>Conclusions</p>
<p>If a reasonable launch schedule is to be maintained, engineering<br />
often cannot be done fast enough to keep up with the expectations of<br />
originally conservative certification criteria designed to guarantee a<br />
very safe vehicle. In these situations, subtly, and often with<br />
apparently logical arguments, the criteria are altered so that flights<br />
may still be certified in time. They therefore fly in a relatively<br />
unsafe condition, with a chance of failure of the order of a percent<br />
(it is difficult to be more accurate).</p>
<p>Official management, on the other hand, claims to believe the<br />
probability of failure is a thousand times less. One reason for this<br />
may be an attempt to assure the government of NASA perfection and<br />
success in order to ensure the supply of funds. The other may be that<br />
they sincerely believed it to be true, demonstrating an almost<br />
incredible lack of communication between themselves and their working<br />
engineers.</p>
<p>In any event this has had very unfortunate consequences, the most<br />
serious of which is to encourage ordinary citizens to fly in such a<br />
dangerous machine, as if it had attained the safety of an ordinary<br />
airliner. The astronauts, like test pilots, should know their risks,<br />
and we honor them for their courage. Who can doubt that McAuliffe was<br />
equally a person of great courage, who was closer to an awareness of<br />
the true risk than NASA management would have us believe?</p>
<p>Let us make recommendations to ensure that NASA officials deal in a<br />
world of reality in understanding technological weaknesses and<br />
imperfections well enough to be actively trying to eliminate<br />
them. They must live in reality in comparing the costs and utility of<br />
the Shuttle to other methods of entering space. And they must be<br />
realistic in making contracts, in estimating costs, and the difficulty<br />
of the projects. Only realistic flight schedules should be proposed,<br />
schedules that have a reasonable chance of being met. If in this way<br />
the government would not support them, then so be it. NASA owes it to<br />
the citizens from whom it asks support to be frank, honest, and<br />
informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for<br />
the use of their limited resources.</p>
<p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over<br />
public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.<br />

<blockquote><p>One may argue whether the abstracted world of mathematics really corresponds to nature. When it comes to risk, though, we have just proved a long-term version of Murphy’s Law - what can go wrong, will go wrong eventually. Just give it time.</p>
